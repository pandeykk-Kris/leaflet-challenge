Module 15 Challenege. Plotting USGS earthquake data using a JSON link
#

The dataset selected contained earthquakes in last one month.
#

Visualized the data by doing the following:
#
Using Leaflet, created a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
#
The data markers (cicles) reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. 
#
Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
#
Included the popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
#
Created a legend to provide context for the map data.
